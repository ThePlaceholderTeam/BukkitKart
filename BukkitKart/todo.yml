To-do list

FEATURES

* Some kind of AI to race against singleplayer (that would be cool)
* We need a cool mystery box display - I was thinking the block could be a piece of alternating rainbow wool - I.E. run a timer to change the block to different types of wool (would be a cool effect) - and we would
check the player's distance (if they get within 1 block) the mystery box would be activated and the player would get whatever random item/power up

BUGS

* Add a dump method where it teleports all players to spawn or something/exits all games onDisable() to prevent exploits

NOTES

* How the structure and track system works:
  - So far the queue system has a command that allows players to queue into a game - it'll be easy to just stick in a line of code that does all the TP'ing and such for the players in and out of the tracks
  i.e a gameStart() method and a gameStop() method
  - I created a track system that will store the tracks Location[] arrays with Properties, it'll be able to save and load tracks flatfile
  - I'm starting a track building mode where server owners/admins/mods can easily create new tracks (with a toggle cmd). They can switch which track they are 'building', it'll automatically create a new track if someone 
  starts building a track that can't be found - not sure if that's a good idea or not. I'm also uncertain whether or not Locations should be stored or Blocks
  - I'm also unsure of how the build mode will work in specifics - should it be toggling different block types? I.e. a player types /cmd startline and every block the build from henceforth will be startLine blocks? Or
  should we pre-define what type of block is what? I.e red wool will always be the startLine block, etc. I'm thinking that on toggling build mode, the player's hotbar is switched to a list of blocks with custom ItemMeta
  that will describe what the block is
  - There are also tons of code redundancies I'll sweep through and fix when I have the time to

* How track builder should work:
  - When toggled on - track building will reset the player's little hot bar with some custom blocks, which they can place to their heart's content and such. It'll save to a track file, which can later be loaded
